**Title** Beyond Copilot - How Developer Tools Are Evolving from Editors to Agents

**Description**: The AI revolution in developer tooling is here. GitHub reported over 1M paid Copilot users. 50% of the latest YC batch are AI companies. And with Open AI landing over $6B in funding. It's safe to say significant shifts are comnig. But, where's the line between hype and reality? Join me for an honest, hype-free examination of the state of AI developer tooling. From reimagined editors like Cursor to AI-powered terminals like Warp to autonomous agents like Devin. We look at whether the future is in long-running agents or in hybrid approaches with humans-in-the-loop? And how we can benefit from this new reality in the decade ahead.
